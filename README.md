**🎨 Cartoonify Images with Python**

This project demonstrates how to convert regular photos into cartoon-style images using Python and OpenCV. The notebook (Cartoon.ipynb) walks through the entire process, from reading an image to applying transformations that give it a cartoon-like effect.

🛠️ Features

Load and process input images

Apply filters for edge detection and smoothing

Combine processed layers to create a cartoon effect

Adjustable parameters for different styles

Works with JPG, PNG, and other common formats

🚀 Technologies Used

Python 3

OpenCV (image processing)

NumPy (numerical operations)

Matplotlib (for displaying results)

📂 Project Workflow

Import required libraries

Load and resize the input image

Apply bilateral filtering for smoothness

Detect edges using adaptive thresholding

Combine edges with smoothened image to generate cartoon effect

Display original vs cartoonized image side by side

▶️ How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/sanjanabh127/Image_processing-3.git
cd cartoonify-images
