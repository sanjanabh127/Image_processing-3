# 📸 Cartoonify Images with Python

This project demonstrates how to convert regular photos into **cartoon-style images** using **Python and OpenCV**.  
The Jupyter Notebook (`Cartoon.ipynb`) walks through the entire process – from reading an image to applying transformations that create a cartoon-like effect.

---

##  Features
- Load and process input images  
- Apply filters for **edge detection** and **smoothing**  
- Combine processed layers to generate a cartoon effect  
- Adjustable parameters for different styles  
- Works with JPG, PNG, and other common formats  

---

##  Technologies Used
- Python 3 🐍  
- OpenCV (cv2) – Image Processing  
- NumPy – Numerical operations  
- Matplotlib – Visualization  

---

##  Project Workflow
1. Import required libraries  
2. Load and resize the input image  
3. Apply **bilateral filtering** for smoothness  
4. Detect edges using **adaptive thresholding**  
5. Combine edges with the smoothened image to generate the cartoon effect  
6. Display **original vs cartoonized** images side by side
